EF 7 has been released at dotnetconf and it brings a heap of new and exciting features. To read about all the new goodnes in this release you can go through the What&amp;rsquo;s new in EF Core 7 docs page.
One of the feature I&amp;rsquo;m more excited about that hasn&amp;rsquo;t been properly advertised (hence this post), in my opinion, is support for what they call Value generation for DDD guarded types.</description></item><item><title>Configure secret-less connection from App Services to Azure Sql via terraform</title><link>https://ilmax.github.io/site/posts/azure-sql-secret-less-conn/</link><pubDate>Wed, 16 Feb 2022 18:17:46 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmax.github.io/site/posts/azure-sql-secret-less-conn/</guid><description>It&amp;rsquo;s been a while since we can connect App services to Azure Sql in a secret-less fashion, using managed service identity (MSI for brevity from now onwards).
The configuration is a bit more complicated than connecting to other Azure services e.g. Azure Storage Account because it involves running some queries on the Azure Sql database in order to create the user and grant them the required privileges, for more info see the tutorial here.</description></item></channel></rss>
