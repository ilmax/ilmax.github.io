Azure Container Apps is a very interesting service that runs on top of Kubernetes adding some additional powerful capabilities in a simple and covinient way. Some of these capabilities are:
Built in support for Keda autoscalers Built in support for Dapr components Ability to scale to zero There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to it, you can dig deeper on the official Microsoft documentation here</description></item><item><title>Create Azure Container Apps with terraform</title><link>https://maxdon.tech/posts/aca-terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 10:04:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maxdon.tech/posts/aca-terraform/</guid><description>Microsoft announced at Microsoft Build that Azure Container Apps are now generally available (GA).
