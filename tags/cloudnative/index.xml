Azure Container Apps is a very interesting service that runs on top of Kubernetes adding some additional powerful capabilities in a simple and covinient way. Some of these capabilities are:
Built in support for Keda autoscalers Built in support for Dapr components Ability to scale to zero There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to it, you can dig deeper on the official Microsoft documentation here</description></item><item><title>Create Azure Container Apps with terraform</title><link>https://ilmax.github.io/site/posts/aca-terraform/</link><pubDate>Thu, 26 May 2022 10:04:06 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://ilmax.github.io/site/posts/aca-terraform/</guid><description>Microsoft announced at Microsoft Build that Azure Container Apps are now generally available (GA).
If you&amp;rsquo;re not familiar with Azure Container Apps (ACA) I suggest you to go and check out the documentation here.
Fully managed serverless container service for building and deploying modern apps at scale
This is how Microsoft itself markets the product.
I think it&amp;rsquo;s a very interesting platform and it offers some of the benefits of Kubernetes, abstracting a lot of concepts and complexity.</description></item></channel></rss>
