Azure Container Apps is a very interesting service that runs on top of Kubernetes adding some additional powerful capabilities in a simple and covinient way. Some of these capabilities are:
Built in support for Keda autoscalers Built in support for Dapr components Ability to scale to zero There&amp;rsquo;s a lot more to it, you can dig deeper on the official Microsoft documentation here</description></item><item><title>Poor mans App services deployment slot auto-swap for Linux with GitHub Actions</title><link>https://maxdon.tech/posts/poor-man-linux-swap/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Dec 2021 18:14:44 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://maxdon.tech/posts/poor-man-linux-swap/</guid><description>Nowadays App Service deployment has became quite straight forward.
