My name is Massimiliano, and I am a software engineer and cloud architect with a passion for all things tech. I was born and raised in Italy, but I have had the opportunity to live and work in the Netherlands, where I currently reside.</p><p>I have been working as a developer since 2008, and in that time, I have had the opportunity to work on a wide range of projects across various industries. As a developer, I am always on the lookout for new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow. I specialize in Azure, .NET, C#, and other cloud-based technologies, and I have a particular interest in Infrastructure as Code (IaC) and DevOps practices. I am also a firm believer in the importance of Cloud Native principles, and I enjoy working on projects that leverage the power of cloud computing to deliver high-performing, scalable solutions.</p><p>In addition to my professional experience, I am also proud to have earned a number of certifications that demonstrate my expertise in my field. These include an Azure certification and a Terraform certification, both of which I have worked hard to achieve and maintain.</p><p>Thank you for visiting my website. I hope you find the content here helpful and informative, and please don&rsquo;t hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or just want to chat about tech.</p><p><div data-iframe-width=350 data-iframe-height=270 data-share-badge-id=f1aaf012-4c60-4ee5-9d20-b8b7903bee5a data-share-badge-host=https://www.credly.com></div><script type=text/javascript async src=//cdn.credly.com/assets/utilities/embed.js></script><div data-iframe-width=350 data-iframe-height=270 data-share-badge-id=322fce03-fd5d-4254-8961-545b6bfedeac data-share-badge-host=https://www.credly.com></div><script type=text/javascript async src=//cdn.credly.com/assets/utilities/embed.js></script></p></div><div class=post-footer></div></article></main></body></html>
